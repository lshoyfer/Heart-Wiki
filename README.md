# Heart

Wiki of media conversation and analysis between friends.

  

### Details must be ironed out but the features will likely include:
- accounts & authentication

- wiki editing & permissions & standard functions

- page creation

- page update

- page deletion

- page edit requests (permissions)

- markdown editor & preview display

- markdown parser (adds links if desired -- first mention of "Sasuke" will link to Sasuke wiki)

- raw conversation upload via Discord bot &/or webhook (a convo is a specialized page)

- discord linkage

- potential automation

- wiki search

- landing page with all displayable content & recently recently edited/visited pages by you & recently edited/popular pages by users

- aiming for 100% Statically Generated, pure avoidance of Server Side Rendering via Next.js incremental static regeneration & (potentially) preview feature
