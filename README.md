# Notice
This ended up being more of a proof of concept exploring Next13 and getting familiar with the ecosystem, which was very valuable.

A lot of the code & css is very crude as I intended to refactor much but I ultimately lost interest. Much is unimplemented / not fully realized. I'd say convos are the jewel in terms of functionality.

The code is as is and has a lot of ramblings & abandoned notes. Again, much busywork and refactoring did not end up coming to
fruition so I apologize -- especially for a lot of the CSS.
